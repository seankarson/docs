	<title>How Gemcached Works</title>
	<shortdesc>Applications use memcached clients to access data stored in embedded Gemcached
		servers. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Applications can use memcached clients that are written in Python, C#, Ruby, PHP, and
			other programming languages. Each memcached server in a cluster stores data as key/value
			pairs. A memcached client maintains a list of these servers, determines which server has
			the required data, and accesses the data directly on that server. </p>
		<p>To integrate memcached with <keyword keyref="product_name_long"/>, you embed a Gemcached
			server within a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> cache server. These <i>Gemcached</i>
			servers take the place of memcached servers. The memcached client uses its normal wire
			protocol to communicate with the Gemcached servers, which appear to the client as
			memcached servers. No code changes in the clients are needed. <keyword
				keyref="product_name"/> manages the distribution and access to data among the
			embedded Gemcached servers. </p>
		<p>As shown in <xref
				href="about_gemcached.xml#concept_4C654CA7F6B34E4CA1B0318BC9644536/fig_8BF351B5FAF1490F8B0D0E7F3098BC73"
				type="fig" format="dita" scope="local"
				><?xm-replace_text Gemcached Architecture?></xref>, memcached clients, which
			ordinarily maintain a list of memcached servers, now maintain a list of embedded
			Gemcached servers. If more embedded Gemcached servers are added to the cluster, the new
			servers automatically become part of the cluster. The memcached clients can continue to
			communicate with the servers on the list, without having to update their list of
			servers. </p>

		<p>Memcached clients use the memcached API to read and write data that is stored in
			memcached servers; therefore, client-side <keyword keyref="product_name"/> features are
			not available to these clients. Gemcached servers, however, can use <keyword
				keyref="product_name"/>'s server-side features and API. These features include the
			following. (For more detail, see <xref scope="local"
