	<title>Deploying Application JARs to <keyword keyref="product_name_long"/> Members</title>
	<shortdesc>You can dynamically deploy your application JAR files to specific members or to all
		members in your distributed system. <keyword keyref="product_name"/> automatically keeps
		track of JAR file versions; autoloads the deployed JAR files to the CLASSPATH; and
		auto-registers any functions that the JAR contains. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>To deploy and undeploy application JAR files in <keyword keyref="product_name_long"/> ,
			use the gfsh <codeph>deploy</codeph> or <codeph>undeploy</codeph> command. You can
			deploy a single JAR or multiple JARs (by either specifying the JAR filenames or by
			specifying a directory that contains the JAR files), and you can also target the
			deployment to a member group or multiple member group. For example, after connecting to
			the distributed system where you want to deploy the JARs, you could type at the
				<codeph>gfsh</codeph> prompt :
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; deploy --jar=group1_functions.jar</codeblock>This command deploys
			the <codeph>group1_functions.jar</codeph> file to all members in the distributed system. </p>
		<p>To deploy the JAR file to a subset of members, use the <codeph>--group</codeph> argument. For
			example:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; deploy --jar=group1_functions.jar --group=MemberGroup1</codeblock>In
			the example it is assumed that you have already defined the member group that you want
			to use when starting up your members. See <xref
				href="../chapter_overview.xml#concept_lrh_gyq_s4"/> for more information on how to
			define member groups and add a member to a group. </p>
		<p>To deploy all the JAR files that are located in a specific directory to all members:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; deploy --dir=libs/group1-libs</codeblock>You can either provide a
			JAR file name or a directory of JARs for deployment, but you cannot specify both at
			once. </p>
		<p>To undeploy all previously deployed JAR files throughout the distributed system:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; undeploy</codeblock>To undeploy a specific JAR file:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; undeploy --jar=group1_functions.jar</codeblock>
		</p>
		<p>To target a specific member group when undeploying all JAR files:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; undeploy --group=MemberGroup1</codeblock>Only JAR files that have
			been previously deployed on members in the MemberGroup1 group will be undeployed. </p>
		<p>To see a list of all deployed JARs in your distributed system:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; list deployed</codeblock>To see a list of all deployed JARs in a
			specific member group:
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt; list deployed --group=MemberGroup1</codeblock>Sample output: </p>

			<title>Deployment Location for JAR Files</title>
			<p>The system location where JAR files are written on each member is determined by the
					<codeph>deploy-working-dir</codeph>
				<keyword keyref="product_name"/> property configured for that member. For example,
				you could have the following configured in the <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph>
				file for your member:
				<codeblock>#gemfire.properties
deploy-working-dir=/usr/local/gemfire/deploy</codeblock>
				This deployment location can be local or a shared network resource (such as a mount
				location) used by multiple members in order to reduce disk space usage. If you use a
				shared directory, you still need to deploy the JAR file on every member that you
				want to have access to the application, because deployment updates the CLASSPATH and
				auto-registers functions. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>About Deploying JAR Files and the Cluster Configuration Service</title>
			<p>By default, the cluster configuration service distributes deployed JAR files to all
				locators in the distributed system. When you start a new server using gfsh, the
				locator supplies configuration files and deployed jar files to the member and writes
				them to the server's directory. </p>
			<p>See <xref href="gfsh_persist.xml"/>. </p>

		<section id="section_D9219C5EEED64672930200677C2118C9">
			<title>Versioning of JAR Files</title>
			<p> When you deploy JAR files to a distributed system or member group, the JAR file is
				modified to indicate version information in its name. Each JAR filename is prefixed
				with <codeph>vf.gf#</codeph> and contains a version number at the end of the
				filename. For example, if you deploy <codeph>MyClasses.jar</codeph> five times, the
				filename is displayed as <codeph>vf.gf#MyClasses.jar#5</codeph> when you list all
				deployed jars. </p>
			<p> When you deploy a new JAR file, the member receiving the deployment checks whether
				the JAR file is a duplicate, either because the JAR file has already been deployed
				on that member or because the JAR file has already been deployed to a shared
				deployment working directory that other members are also using. If another member
				has already deployed this JAR file to the shared directory (determined by doing a
				byte-for-byte compare to the latest version in its directory), the member receiving
				the latest deployment does not write the file to disk. Instead, the member updates
				the ClassPathLoader to use the already deployed JAR file. If a newer version of the
				JAR file is detected on disk and is already in use, the deployment is canceled. </p>
			<p> When a member begins using a JAR file, the member obtains a shared lock on the file.
				If the member receives a newer version by deployment, the member releases the shared
				lock and tries to delete the existing JAR file in favor of the newer version. If no
				other member has a shared lock on the existing JAR, the existing, older version JAR
				is deleted. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="section_F8AC59EEC8C5434FBC6F38A12A7371CE">
			<title>Automatic Class Path Loading</title>
			<p> When a cache is started, the new cache requests that the latest versions of each JAR
				file in the current working directory be added to the ClassPathLoader. If a JAR file
				has already been deployed to the ClassPathLoader, the ClassPathLoader updates its
				loaded version if a newer version is found; otherwise, there is no change. If
				detected, older versions of the JAR files are deleted if no other member has a
				shared lock on them. </p>
			<p>Undeploying a JAR file does not automatically unload the classes that were loaded
				during deployment. You need to restart your members to unload those classes. </p>
			<p>When a cache is closed it requests that all currently deployed JAR files be removed
				from the ClassPathLoader. </p>
			<p>If you are using a shared deployment working directory, all members sharing the
				directory should belong to the same member group. Upon restart, all members that
				share the same deployment working directory will deploy and autoload their CLASSPATH
				with any JARs found in the current working directory. This means that some members
				may load the JARs even though they are not part of the member group that received
				the original deployment. </p>

			<title> Automatic Function Registration</title>
			<p> When you deploy a JAR file that contains a function (in other words, contains a
				class that implements the Function interface), the function is automatically
				registered through the <codeph>FunctionService.registerFunction</codeph> method. If
				another JAR file is deployed (either with the same JAR filename or another filename)
				with the same function, the new implementation of the function is registered,
				overwriting the old one. If a JAR file is undeployed, any functions that were
				auto-registered at the time of deployment are unregistered. Because deploying a JAR
				file that has the same name multiple times results in the JAR being un-deployed and
				re-deployed, functions in the JAR are unregistered and re-registered each time this
				occurs. If a function with the same ID is registered from multiple differently named
				JAR files, the function is unregistered if any of those JAR files are re-deployed or
				un-deployed. </p>
			<p> During <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> load, the parameters for any declarables are
				saved. If functions found in a JAR file are also declarable, and have the same class
				name as the declarables whose parameters were saved after loading cache.xml, then
				function instances are created using those Parameters and are also registered.
				Therefore, if the same function is declared multiple times in the
					<codeph>cache.xml</codeph> with different sets of parameters, when the JAR is
				deployed a function is instantiated for each set of parameters. If any functions are
				registered using parameters from a <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> load, the default,
				no-argument function is not registered. </p>
