			<title>Online Backup</title>
			<p>The gfsh backup operation creates a backup of disk stores for all members running in
				the distributed system when the backup command is invoked. <note>Do not try to
					create backup files from a running system by using your operating system's file
					copy commands. You will get incomplete and unusable copies. </note>
			</p>
			<p>The backup works by passing commands to the running system members. Each member with
				persistent data creates a backup of its own configuration and disk stores. The
				backup does not block any activities in the distributed system, but it does use
				resources. </p>

					<li id="li_A967EDBF57AA44E0A64A0BD6DC27C333">You might want to compact your disk
						store before running the backup. If auto-compaction is turned off, you may
						want to do a manual compaction to save on how much data will be copied over
						your network by the backup. For more information on configuring a manual
						compaction, see <xref scope="local"

			<title>What an Incremental Online Backup Saves</title>
			<p>An incremental backup saves the difference between the last backup and the current
				data. An incremental backup copies only operations logs that are not already present
				in the baseline directories for each member. For incremental backups, the restore
				script contains explicit references to operation logs in one or more previously
				chained incremental backups. When the restore script is run from an incremental
				backup, it also restores the operation logs from previous incremental backups that
				are part of the backup chain. </p>
			<p>If members are missing from the baseline directory because they were offline or did
				not exist at the time of the baseline backup, those members place full backups of
				all their files into the incremental backup directory. </p>
