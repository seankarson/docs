			<p>The <codeph>shutdown</codeph> command provides an ordered shutdown to your system
				that gives you the fastest startup times. </p>
			<p> This is particularly useful for persistent partitioned region shutdown, as it
				synchronizes all of the online region data stores before shutdown. This means every
				disk store has the most recent data and does not require updates from other members
				at startup. See also <xref scope="local"
