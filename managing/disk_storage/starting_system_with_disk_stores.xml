					<li id="li_6BD1656398CD493F8B27445F75C4A982"><b>Start all members with persisted
							data first and at the same time</b>. Exactly how you do this depends on
						your members. <p>When you start members with persisted data in parallel, you
							get the most efficient system startup. While they are initializing their
							caches, the members determine which have the most recent region data,
							and initialize their caches from that. </p>
						<p>
							<note>For replicates, where you can define persistence only in some of
								the region's host members, start the persistent replicates before
								the non-persistent replicates to make sure the data is recovered
								from disk. </note>
						</p>
						<p>This is an example bash script for starting members in parallel. The
							script waits for the startup to finish and exits with an error status if
							one of the jobs fails.
