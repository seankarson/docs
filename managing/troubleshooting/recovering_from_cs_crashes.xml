	<title>Recovering from Crashes with a Client/Server Configuration</title>
	<shortdesc>In a client/server configuration, you first make the server available as a member of
		a distributed system again, and then restart clients as quickly as possible. The client

			<p>How well a client/server configuration recovers from application or cache server crashes
				depends on server availability and on client configuration. Typically, the servers
				are made highly available by running enough servers spread out on enough machines to
				ensure a minimum of coverage in case of network, machine, or server crashes. The
				clients are usually configured to connect to a primary and some number of secondary,
				or redundant, servers. The secondaries act as hot backups to the primary. For high
				availability of messaging in the case of client crashes, the clients may have
				durable connections to their servers. If this is the case, some or all of their data
				and data events remain in server memory and are automatically recovered, providing
				that you restart the clients within a configured timeout. See <xref
					href="../../developing/events/configure_client_server_event_messaging.xml#receiving_events_from_servers"
				/> for information about durable messaging. </p>

			<title>Recovering from Server Failure </title>
			<p>Recovery from server failure has two parts: the server recovers as a member of a
				distributed system, then its clients recover its services. </p>
			<p>When servers fail, their own recovery is carried out as for any member of a
				distributed system as described in <xref
					href="recovering_from_p2p_crashes.xml#rec_app_p2p_crash" type="concept"
					format="dita" scope="local"
					><?xm-replace_text Recovering from Crashes with a Peer-to-Peer Configuration?></xref>. </p>
			<p>From the client’s perspective, if the system is configured for high availability,
				server failure goes undetected unless enough servers fail that the server-to-client
				ratio drops below a workable level. In any case, your first course of action is to
				get the servers back up as quickly as possible. </p>
			<p>To recover from server failure: <ol id="ol_70B53952FD444E7D994745BDACFC9C8C">
					<li id="li_EDB68FD62CC4416781320F625BDE2725">Recover the server and its data as

						the locators (or client pools if you are using a static server list)
						automatically detect its presence and add it to the list of viable servers.

			<p><b>If you need to start a server at a new host/port location </b>
			</p>
			<p>This section is only for systems where the clients’ server pool configurations use
				static server lists. This is unusual, but might be the case for your system. If the
				server pools are configured without static server lists, meaning clients use
				locators to find their servers, starting a server at a new address requires no
				special action because the new server is automatically detected by the locators. You
				can determine whether your clients use locator lists or server lists by looking at
				the client <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> files. Systems configured with static server
				lists have &lt;server&gt; elements listed inside the &lt;pool&gt; elements. Those
				using locator lists have &lt;locator&gt; elements instead. If there are no pools
				declared in the XML files, the servers or locators will be defined in the
				application code. Look for the API PoolFactory methods addServer or addLocator. </p>
			<p>If the pools are configured with static server lists, the clients only connect to
				servers at the specific addresses provided in the lists. To move a server or add a
				server at a new location, you must modify the &lt;server&gt; specifications in the
				clients’ <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> file. This change will only affect newly-started
				clients. To start using the new server information, either restart clients or wait
				for new clients to start, depending on your system characteristics and how quickly
				you need the changes to take effect. </p>

			<title>Recovering from Client Failure</title>
			<p>When a client crashes, restart it as quickly as possible in the usual way. The client
				recovers its data from its servers through normal operation. Some of the data may be
				recovered immediately, and some may be recovered lazily as the client requests it.
				Additionally, the server may be configured to replay events for some data and for
				some client queries. These are the different configurations that affect client
				recovery: <ul id="ul_56ED8F44D3CE404AA0C327B26244A62F">
					<li id="li_5DF183374BA84EE1B9493E71C3AC4D3C"><b>Entries immediately sent to the
							client</b>—Entries are immediately sent to the client for entries the
						client registers interest in, if those entries are present in the server
						cache. </li>
					<li id="li_391CC602B20B40EE9C890BEAF0F16DAF"><b>Entries sent lazily to the
							client</b>—Entries are sent lazily to the client for entries that the
						client registers interest in that are not initially available in the server
						cache. </li>
					<li id="li_D675D69274EB442D8251C4B10FAFAFD6"><b>Events sent immediately to the
							client</b>—If the server has been saving events for the client, these
						are immediately replayed when the client reconnects. Cache modification
						events for entries in which the client has registered durable interest are
						saved. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>If you have a durable client configured to connect to multiple servers, keep in mind
				that <keyword keyref="product_name"/> does not maintain server redundancy while the
				client is disconnected. If you lose all of its primary and secondary servers, you
				lose the client’s queued messages. Even if the servers fail one at a time, so that
				running clients have time to fail over and pick new secondary servers, an off-line
				durable client cannot do that and thus loses its queued messages. </p>
