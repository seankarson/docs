	<title>Setting Socket Buffer Sizes</title>
	<shortdesc>When you determine buffer size settings, you try to strike a balance between
		communication needs and other processing. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Larger socket buffers allow your members to distribute data and events more quickly, but
			they also take memory away from other things. If you store very large data objects in
			your cache, finding the right sizing for your buffers while leaving enough memory for
			the cached data can become critical to system performance. </p>
		<p>Ideally, you should have buffers large enough for the distribution of any single data
			object so you don’t get message fragmentation, which lowers performance. Your buffers
			should be at least as large as your largest stored objects and their keys plus some
			overhead for message headers. The overhead varies depending on the who is sending and
			receiving, but 100 bytes should be sufficient. You can also look at the statistics for
			the communication between your processes to see how many bytes are being sent and
			received. </p>
		<p>If you see performance problems and logging messages indicating blocked writers,
			increasing your buffer sizes may help. </p>
		<p>This table lists the settings for the various member relationships and protocols, and
			tells where to set them. </p>

			<b>TCP/IP Buffer Sizes</b>
		</p>
		<p>If possible, your TCP/IP buffer size settings should match across your <keyword keyref="product_name"/>
			installation. At a minimum, follow the guidelines listed here. </p>
		<p>
			<ul id="ul_9FD9276320D747968BA88B43075AF8BA">
				<li id="li_44FBC74C65F141D4A300CC7685F7545E"><b>Peer-to-peer</b>. The
					socket-buffer-size setting in <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph> should be the
					same throughout your distributed system. </li>
				<li id="li_7549FB973E094AE8A7DF432CFCAB7E33"><b>Client/server</b>. The client’s pool

					<codeblock><b>Client Socket Buffer Size <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> Configuration:</b>

<b>Server Socket Buffer Size <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> Configuration:</b>

		<p>
			<b>UDP Multicast and Unicast Buffer Sizes</b>
		</p>
		<p>With UDP communication, one receiver can have many senders sending to it at once. To
			accommodate all of the transmissions, the receiving buffer should be larger than the sum
			of the sending buffers. If you have a system with at most five members running at any
			time, in which all members update their data regions, you would set the receiving buffer
			to at least five times the size of the sending buffer. If you have a system with
			producer and consumer members, where only two producer members ever run at once, the
			receiving buffer sizes should be set at over two times the sending buffer sizes, as
			shown in this example:
			<codeblock>mcast-send-buffer-size=42000
mcast-recv-buffer-size=90000
udp-send-buffer-size=42000
udp-recv-buffer-size=90000</codeblock>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Operating System Limits</b>
		</p>
		<p>Your operating system sets limits on the buffer sizes it allows. If you request a size
			larger than the allowed, you may get warnings or exceptions about the setting during
			startup. These are two examples of the type of message you may see:
			<codeblock>[warning 2008/06/24 16:32:20.286 PDT CacheRunner &lt;main&gt; tid=0x1]
requested multicast send buffer size of 9999999 but got 262144: see 
system administration guide for how to adjust your OS 

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not 
set "socket-buffer-size" to "99262144" because its value can not be 
greater than "20000000".</codeblock>
		</p>
		<p>If you think you are requesting more space for your buffer sizes than your system allows,
			check with your system administrator about adjusting the operating system limits. </p>
