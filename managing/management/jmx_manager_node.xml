		<title>JMX Manager Operations</title>
		<shortdesc>Any member can host an embedded JMX Manager, which provides a federated view of
			all MBeans for the distributed system. The member can be configured to be a manager at
			startup or anytime during its life by invoking the appropriate API calls on the
			ManagementService. </shortdesc>
		<body>
			<p>You need to have a JMX Manager started in your distributed system in order to use
					<keyword keyref="product_name"/> management and monitoring tools such as <xref
					href="../../tools_modules/gfsh/chapter_overview.xml#concept_36339CCA6323430D8B61EE8DC5F64DCB"
					type="concept" format="dita" scope="local">gfsh</xref> and <xref

					Pulse</xref>. </p>
			<p>
				<note>Each node that acts as the JMX Manager has additional memory requirements
					depending on the number of resources that it is managing and monitoring. Being a
					JMX Manager can increase the memory footprint of any process, including locator
					processes. See <xref
						href="../../reference/topics/memory_requirements_for_cache_data.xml#calculating_memory_requirements"
					/> for more information on calculating memory overhead on your <keyword
						keyref="product_name"/> processes.</note>
