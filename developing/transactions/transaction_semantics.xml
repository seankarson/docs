	<title><keyword keyref="product_name"/> Cache Transaction Semantics</title>
	<conbody>
		<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> transaction semantics differ in some ways from the semantics
			of traditional relational databases. </p>
		<section id="section_8362ACD06C784B5BBB0B7E986F760169">
			<title>Atomicity</title>
			<p>Atomicity is “all or nothing” behavior: a transaction completes successfully only when all of
				the operations it contains complete successfully. If problems occur during a
				transaction, perhaps due to other transactions with overlapping changes, the
				transaction cannot successfully complete until the problems are resolved.</p>
			<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> transactions provide atomicity and realize speed by using a
				reservation system, instead of using the traditional relational database technique
				of a two-phase locking of rows. The reservation prevents other, intersecting
				transactions from completing , allowing the commit to check for conflicts and to
				reserve resources in an all-or-nothing fashion prior to making changes to the data.
				After all changes have been made, locally and remotely, the reservation is released.
				With the reservation system, an intersecting transaction is simply discarded. The
				serialization of obtaining locks is avoided. See <xref
					href="how_cache_transactions_work.xml#concept_sbj_lj1_wk"/> for details on the
				two-phase commit protocol that implements the reservation system.</p>

			<title>Consistency</title>
			<p>Consistency requires that data written within a transaction must observe the key and value
				constraints established for the affected region. Note that validity of the
				transaction is the responsibility of the application.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="section_126A24EC499D4CF39AE766A0B526A9A5">
			<title>Isolation</title>
			<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> transactions support repeatable read isolation, so
				once the committed value is read for a given key, it always returns that same value.
				If a transaction write, such as put or invalidate, deletes a value for a key that
				has already been read, subsequent reads return the transactional reference. </p>
			<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> isolates transactions at the process thread level, so 
				while a transaction is in progress, its changes are visible only inside the
				thread that is running the transaction. Threads inside the same process and in other
				processes cannot see changes until after the commit operation begins. At this point  
				the changes are visible in the cache, but other threads that access the 
				changing data might see only partial results of the transaction.</p>
			<p>Isolation assures that read operations will see either the pre-transaction state of the system
				or its post-transaction state, but not the transitional state that occurs while a
				transaction is in progress. As a distributed cache-based system optimized for
				performance, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> in its default configuration does not
				enforce isolation. It allows transactional writes to proceed without being slowed
				down by in-progress reads.</p>
			<p>Applications can emulate the slow conventional isolation model by doing the extra
					work of encapsulating their read operations within transactions. The application
					sets the <codeph>gemfire.detectReadConflicts </codeph>parameter to ‘true’:</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><codeph>-Dgemfire.detectReadConflicts=true</codeph></p>
			<p>This causes
				read operations to succeed only when they read a consistent pre- or
				post-transactional state.</p>

			<title>Durability</title>
			<p>Relational databases provide durability by using disk storage for recovery and transaction
				logging. As a distributed cache-based system optimized for performance,  <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> does not support on-disk or in-memory durability for
				transactions. </p>
			<p>Applications can emulate the conventional disk-based durability model by setting the
					<codeph>gemfire.ALLOW_PERSISTENT_TRANSACTIONS</codeph> parameter to ‘true’.</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><codeph>-Dgemfire.ALLOW_PERSISTENT_TRANSACTIONS=true</codeph></p><p>This allows permanent regions to participate in transactions, thus providing disc-based
				durability. See <xref
					href="cache_transactions_by_region_type.xml#concept_omy_341_wk"/> for more
				detail on the use of this parameter.</p>
