  <title>Data Location for Cache Transactions</title>
  <shortdesc>The location where you can run your transaction depends on where you are storing your
    data. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Transactions must be run on a data set hosted entirely by one member. <ul
        id="ul_ws2_bc1_wk">
        <li>For replicated or other distributed regions, the transaction uses only the data set in
          the member where the transaction is run.</li>
        <li>For partitioned regions, you must co-locate all your transactional data in a single
          member.</li>
        <li>For transactions run on partitioned and distributed region mixes, you must co-locate the
          partitioned region data and make sure the distributed region data is available in any
          member hosting the partitioned region data.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>For transactions involving partitioned regions, any member with the regions defined can run
      the transactional application, regardless of whether the member hosts data for the regions. If
      the transactional data resides on a remote member, the transaction is carried out by proxy in
      the member hosting the data. The member hosting the data is referred to as the transactional
      data host.</p>
