				<p>Applications manage transactions on a per-cache basis. A <keyword
						keyref="product_name"/> cache transaction starts with a
						<codeph>CacheTransactionManager.begin</codeph> method and continues with a
					series of operations, which are typically region operations such as region
					create, clear and destroy. The begin, commit, and rollback are directly
					controlled by the application. A commit, failed commit, or voluntary rollback by
					the transaction manager ends the transaction. </p>
				<p>You can run transactions on any type of cache region except regions with
						<b>global</b> scope. A transaction attempted on these regions throws an
						<codeph>UnsupportedOperationException</codeph>. </p>
				<p>Before you begin, have your members and regions defined where you want to run
					transactions. </p>
				<p>
					<note>The discussions on transactions in this guide use replicated and
						partitioned regions. If you use non-replicated distributed regions, follow
						the guidelines for replicated regions. </note>

						<b>Update your cache event handler and transaction event handler
							implementations to handle your transactions.</b>
					</cmd>
					<info>
						<p>Cache event handlers are all used for transactions. Cache listeners are
							called after the commit, instead of after each cache operation, and they
							receive the conflated transaction events. Cache writers and loaders are
							called as usual, as the operations are done. </p>
						<p>Follow these additional guidelines when writing your cache event handler
							callbacks: <ul id="ul_uwx_lv3_5k">
								<li id="li_C140791F29BF41EA975FF723E721774D">Make sure cache
									callbacks are transactionally aware. A transactional operation
									can launch callbacks that are not transactional. </li>
								<li id="li_9B5E2EC270E24279BFBBC6C9ED562384">Make sure cache
									listeners will operate properly with the entry event conflation
									done for transactional operations. Two entry events for the same
									key are conflated by removing the existing event and adding the
									new event to the end of the list. </li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>See <xref href="working_with_transactions.xml#concept_ysx_nf1_wk"/> for
							more information. </p>
						<p>If desired, you can also configure transaction event handlers.
							Transaction event handlers are cache-wide. You can install one
							transaction writer and any number of transaction listeners. Use the
							following guidelines: <ul id="ul_cvd_gw3_5k">
								<li id="li_146AAB2438194C1BA2E1AC0FFE2B1E10">Program with
									synchronization for thread-safety. Your listener and writer
									methods may be called simultaneously by different threads for
									different transactions. </li>
								<li id="li_C44EC8D69EB543F5A7B040D96865F429">Keep your transactional
									callback implementations lightweight and avoid doing anything
									that might cause them to block. </li>

								<li id="li_F5C54C26369B4947BA3EA22B124E4935">Consider whether you
									will want to suspend and resume the transaction. If some

										href="transaction_suspend_resume_example.xml#concept_40AAC4332DCE4E4EB60C4BA141B729A4"
									/> for an example. </li>
								<li id="li_3DD31608D05245048BAF64E1A6FD1E1D">If your transaction
									runs on a mix of partitioned and replicated regions, perform

								<li id="li_A6578FB6A61F486B873AD117E96F0E9D">Take into account the

								<li id="li_096C06567123466F82547DD76FE7429F">End each transaction

						<b>Review all of your code for compatibility with transactions.</b>
					</cmd>
					<info>
						<p>When you commit a transaction, while the commit is taking place, the
							changes are visible in the distributed cache. This provides better
							performance than locking everything involved with the transaction
							updates, but it means that another process accessing data used in the
							transaction might get some data in the pre-transaction state and some in
							the post-transaction state. </p>
						<p>For example, suppose key 1 and 2 are written to in a transaction so both
							of their values change from A to B. In another thread, it is possible to
							read key 1 with value B and key 2 with value A, while the transaction is
							being committed. This is possible due to the nature of <keyword
								keyref="product_name"/> reads. This choice sacrifices atomic
							visibility in favor of performance; reads do not block writes, and
							writes do not block reads. </p>
