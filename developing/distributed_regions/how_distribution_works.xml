	<title>How Distribution Works</title>
	<shortdesc>To use distributed and replicated regions, you should understand how they work and
		your options for managing them. </shortdesc>

			<note> The management of replicated and distributed regions supplements the general
				information for managing data regions provided in <xref
					href="../../basic_config/book_intro.xml" format="dita"
				/>. See also <codeph>com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.PartitionAttributes</codeph>. </note>
			<p>A distributed region automatically sends entry value updates to remote caches and
				receives updates from them. <ul id="ul_1D81390D8B064B188B341235A1B9B709">
					<li id="li_E86CFB306B5B46339D420D2AFBE788D3">Distributed entry updates come from
						the <codeph>Region</codeph>
						<codeph>put</codeph> and <codeph>create</codeph> operations (the creation of
						an entry with a non-null value is seen as an update by remote caches that
						already have the entry key). Entry updates are distributed selectively -
						only to caches where the entry key is already defined. This provides a pull
						model of distribution, compared to the push model that you get with
						replication. </li>
					<li id="li_CD9EDC46FA1E4A5286FA010735D8AED1">Distribution alone does not cause
						new entries to be copied from remote caches. </li>
					<li id="li_A87937D4BABC4F82B1D7BD72F390E258">A distributed region shares cache
						loader and cache writer application event handler plug-ins across the
						distributed system. </li>

			<p>In a distributed region, new and updated entry values are automatically distributed
				to remote caches that already have the entries defined. <ul
