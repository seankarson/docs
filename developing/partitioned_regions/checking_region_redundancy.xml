  <title>Checking Redundancy in Partitioned Regions</title>
  <shortdesc>Under some circumstances, it can be important to verify that your partitioned region
    data is redundant and that upon member restart, redundancy has been recovered properly across
    partitioned region members.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You can verify partitioned region redundancy by making sure that the
        <codeph>numBucketsWithoutRedundancy</codeph> statistic is <b>zero</b> for all your
      partitioned regions. To check this statistic, use the following <codeph>gfsh</codeph>
      command:<codeblock>gfsh>show metrics --categories=partition --region=<varname>region_name</varname></codeblock></p>
    <p>For
      example:<codeblock>gfsh>show metrics --categories=partition --region=posts

Cluster-wide Region Metrics
--------- | --------------------------- | -----
partition | putLocalRate                | 0
          | putRemoteRate               | 0
          | putRemoteLatency            | 0
          | putRemoteAvgLatency         | 0
          | bucketCount                 | 1
          | primaryBucketCount          | 1
          <b>| numBucketsWithoutRedundancy | 1</b>
          | minBucketSize               | 1
          | maxBucketSize               | 0
          | totalBucketSize             | 1
          | averageBucketSize           | 1
      </codeblock></p>
    <p>If you have <codeph>start-recovery-delay=-1</codeph> configured for your partitioned region,
      you will need to perform a rebalance on your region after you restart any members in your
      cluster in order to recover redundancy.</p>
    <p> If you have <codeph>start-recovery-delay</codeph> set to a low number, you may need to wait
      extra time until the region has recovered redundancy. </p>
