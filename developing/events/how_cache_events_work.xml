			<title>Managing Events in Multi-threaded Applications</title>
			<p>For partitioned regions, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> guarantees ordering of
				events across threads, but for distributed regions it doesn’t. For multi-threaded
				applications that create distributed regions, you need to use your application
				synchronization to make sure that one operation completes before the next one
				begins. Distribution through the distributed-no-ack queue can work with multiple
				threads if you set the <codeph>conserve-sockets</codeph> attribute to true. Then the
				threads share one queue, preserving the order of the events in distributed regions.
				Different threads can invoke the same listener, so if you allow different threads to
				send events, it can result in concurrent invocations of the listener. This is an
				issue only if the threads have some shared state - if they are incrementing a serial
				number, for example, or adding their events to a log queue. Then you need to make
				your code thread safe. </p>
