	<title>gemfire.properties and gfsecurity.properties (<keyword keyref="product_name"/>
		Properties)</title>
	<shortdesc>You use the <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph> settings to join a distributed system
		and configure system member behavior. Distributed system members include applications, the
		cache server, the locator, and other <keyword keyref="product_name"/> processes. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You can place any security-related (properties that begin with
				<codeph>security-*</codeph>) configuration properties in
				<codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph> into a separate
				<codeph>gfsecurity.properties</codeph> file. Placing these configuration settings in
			a separate file allows you to restrict access to security configuration data. This way,
			you can still allow read or write access for your <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph>
			file. </p>
		<p>You can also define provider-specific properties ("ssl" properties) in
				<codeph>gfsecurity.properties</codeph> instead of defining them at the command-line
			or in your environment.</p>
		<p>You can specify non-ASCII text in your properties files by using Unicode escape
			sequences. See <xref
				href="non-ascii_strings_in_config_files.xml#concept_D3BC1489F5D8494799E8D2A8FE7EE81D"
				type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"/> for more details. </p>
		<note>Unless otherwise indicated, these settings only affect activities within this
			distributed system - not activities between clients and servers. </note>
